# Least common multiple
For two positive non-zero integers `a` and `b`, LCM or Least Common Multiple is the minimum number that is divisible by both `a` and `b`.

for example, LCM of 5 and 10 will be 10.

Least common multiple is an extension of GCD. It's lot easier to figure out LCM using the relation that `lcm = (a * b)/gcd`

## Run it yourself
This code uses Python 3. There are two algorithms mentioned here, naive and fast. Both can be executed from terminal as:

`python3 <filename.py>`
