# Mode
Mode is the cool kid in central tendencies. Think of it as the most popular data point.

# How to calculate
To get the mode, we need to get the frequency for each element. The element with most frequency is the mode. There can be more than one modes. This code gives the first element with most frequency in case of multiple modes, but all other elements are mode as well.

## Run it yourself
This code uses Python 3. If you have Python 3 installed, just run the following at your terminal:

`python3 <filename.py>`


This takes two sets of input. First input the length of your data. Then input the data in the next line separated by space. Use `CTRL + d` to mark end of input. Make sure you try with multiple modes as well..
