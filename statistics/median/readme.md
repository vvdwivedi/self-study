# Median
Mean is also a measure of central tendency for a set of data. Think of it as a value dividing a set of data in two equal halves.

# How to calculate
To get the median, we need to find the value that divides a set of data in two parts. If the number of items in data set are odd, it's simply element at (n/2 + 1).

If there are even number of items, we take the mean of elements at n/2 and n/2 + 1.

## Run it yourself
This code uses Python 3. If you have Python 3 installed, just run the following at your terminal:

`python3 <filename.py>`


This takes two sets of input. First input the length of your data. Then input the data in the next line separated by space. Use `CTRL + d` to mark end of input. Make sure to test for odd and even number of elements.
