# Mean or Average
Mean is a measure of central tendency for a set of data.

# How to calculate
To calculate mean for a set of data, we need to sum all the numbers in our data set and divide by number of data points.

## Run it yourself
This code uses Python 3. If you have Python 3 installed, just run the following at your terminal:

`python3 <filename.py>`


This takes two sets of input. First input the length of your data. Then input the data in the next line separated by space. Use `CTRL + d` to mark end of input.
